<h1>Overwatch Data Analysis Project</h1>
A Personal Data Analysis Project of my performance in Overwatch! 

<h2><b>About<b></h2>
  This is my data analysis project of my performance in Overwatch. Last year, I started this as a neat project that 
  I could do in an attempt to learn more about data science and Machine Learning. So I decided to manually collect data
  that I can do an analysis with. Unfortunately, the data is incomplete as I stopped collecting the data in the middle
  of Season 12, due to various factors out of my control. The data I used I collected myself and is on a google sheet that I have! 
  I am hoping that I can do another version of this project once the newest Overwatch Season starts up, which will (hopefully) have
  role lock put into place which will make data collecting a bit easier.
  
  For now, this is a brief analysis of my season 12 performance compared to my previous performances in the previous season.
